# Titan

Titan is an opinionated full-stack web application framework.

It attempts to incorporate many of the latest web technologies, whilst handling all the boring bits of building applications for you - so you can focus on, you know, building a startup.

It consists of three main projects:

- `/client`: Where our client-side code is imported.
- `/imports`:
  - `/api`: Where all our Apollo code is written.
  - `/startup`: where we initialise both the server and client side.
  - `/ui`: Where we write our React code.
- `/server`: Where our server-side code is imported.

- `/meteor`: Which is boring meteor set-up.
- `/node_modules`: Which are exciting packages.

## Getting Up and Running

Once you have cloned the repo, follow these steps to start a local development instance of the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the root of the directory and run `meteor` - this will install dependencies and run the app.
2. There is no step 2 - you're done! ðŸŽ‰
   - Visit the website: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
   - Write GraphQL queries: [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql)

## Deployment

Once youâ€™ve built and tested your Titan application, you need to put it online to show it to the world. Titan uses Meteor as it's base framework, so for deployment you can follow along with their guide:
