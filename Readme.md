# Apollo

This is me playing around with Apollo + Meteor + React to build full-stack applications and to take over the üåç.

It consists of three main projects:

- `/client`: Where our client-side code is imported.
- `/imports`:
  - `/api`: Where all our Apollo code is written.
  - `/startup`: where we initialise both the server and client side.
  - `/ui`: Where we write our React code.
- `/server`: Where our server-side code is imported.

- `/meteor`: Which is boring meteor set-up.
- `/node_modules`: Which are exciting packages.

## Getting Up and Running

Once you have cloned the repo, follow these steps to start a local development instance of the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the root of the directory and run `meteor` - this will install dependencies and run the app.
2. There is no step 2 - you're done! üéâ
   - Visit the website: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
   - Write GraphQL queries: [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql)
